# This is a Flask app for birders.  
It allows birders to add birds sighted to annual and lifetime lists.  
Allows users to search their own lists and lists of other users by filters such as bird name, state, county, date sighted.
Allows users to search Cornell's eBird crowd-sourced database, searching for sightings by state, county, and number of days in the past.
Includes a bird/cat fun page.
